# WEB-PROJECT
This project is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Web Speech API's SpeechSynthesis to convert text input into spoken audio client-side.  Users can type text and hit 'Speak' to hear it. Features include voice selection and controls for adjusting pitch and rate (speed).
